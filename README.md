# ShootProof List Checker

ShootProof allows their clients' clients' to select their favorite photos via the galleries. The way the photographers are able to view the client favorites can allow them to use this as a way to give their clients an option to select the photos that they would like to have edited virtually (given they allow their clients to access or purchase their unedited pictures).

The system allows multiple batches of favorites for the clients, but it does not, however, allow (on the photographer's side) to compare these favorites to see which photos are the commonalities in these batches of favorites. This tool will aid the photographer in comparing the lists/batches of favorites to see which photos are in both lists.
